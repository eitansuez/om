# Authentication
OM will by preference use Client ID and Client Secret if provided. To create a Client ID and Client Secret

1. `uaac target https://YOUR_OPSMANAGER/uaa`
1. `uaac token sso get` if using SAML or `uaac token owner get` if using internal auth. Specify the Client ID as `opsman` and leave Client Secret blank.
1. Generate a client ID and secret

```
uaac client add -i
Client ID:  NEW_CLIENT_NAME
New client secret:  DESIRED_PASSWORD
Verify new client secret:  DESIRED_PASSWORD
scope (list):  opsman.admin
authorized grant types (list):  client_credentials
authorities (list):  opsman.admin
access token validity (seconds):  43200
refresh token validity (seconds):  43200
